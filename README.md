# Radial-Basis-Function-Networks-Deep-Learning
RBFNs are special types of feedforward neural networks that use radial basis functions as activation functions. They have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer and are mostly used for classification, regression, and time-series prediction.
This is the Python Code for the Radial Basis Function Network by using the iris dataset and randomly selecting 50 centroids.
